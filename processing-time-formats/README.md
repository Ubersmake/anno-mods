# Processing Time Formats

Provides several different formats for Processing Time values on production buildings.

The Anno series uses tons as a de facto unit of mass. That has been kept for most of these formats.

- Seconds only: `01:30` -> `90 s`
- Tons per minute, rounded up: `01:30` -> `0.7 t/m`
